  * Detect changes to moved conffiles (LP: #1823872)
    - Add tests for checking conffile moves.
      Build depend on and use equivs to generate new test packages
    - Split() conffile data to set of names only once
    - Don't parse dpkg conffile db when there are no conffiles in the package
  * Detect unchanged moved conffiles.
    When a package moves a conffile properly without any change no conffile
    prompt needs to be shown thus the package can be upgraded unattended.
    (LP: #1823872)
  * Skip sending email when no package had to be installed, upgraded or removed
    (LP: #1821103) (Closes: #924554)
  * Make sure autoremovals don't start with a dirty cache and remove other
    packages (LP: #1824341)
  * Continue applying minimal sets when one set can't be marked for upgrade.
    Thanks to Anderson Luiz Alves for the patch, it needed minor modifications
    (LP: #1824341)
  * Stop raising NoAllowedOriginError when marking packages to upgrade/install
    fails (LP: #1824876)
  * Adjust only transitive dependencies in the fallback when a package from an
    allowed origin can't be marked to install/upgrade.
    This is a much lighter approach than marking every upgradable package
    because the full fallback was triggered on packages held back as well,
    using an excessive amount of CPU time.
    Also it crashed with packages not having any version in allowed origins.
    (LP: #1824804, #1824949)
  * Skip trying to upgrade held packages in call_adjusted() (LP: #1824804)
  * Follow all kinds of transitive dependencies when adjusting dependencies
  * Don't crash collecting transitive dependencies when package has no candidate
    (LP: #1825886)
  * Use mark_install_adjusted() in rewind_cache()
    The original cache had packages marked with adjustments thus rewinding
    should also do adjustments to reach the same state.
    Also not using mark_install_adjusted() crashes when apt raises error on
    held packages. (LP: #1826157)

unattended-upgrades (1.1ubuntu1.18.04.7) bionic; urgency=medium

  * Trigger unattended-upgrade-shutdown actions with PrepareForShutdown()
    Performing upgrades in service's ExecStop did not work when the upgrades
    involved restarting services because systemd blocked other stop/start
    actions making maintainer scripts time out and be killed leaving a broken
    system behind.
    Running unattended-upgrades.service before shutdown.target as a oneshot
    service made it run after unmounting filesystems and scheduling services
    properly on shutdown is a complex problem and adding more services to the
    mix make it even more fragile.
    The solution of monitoring PrepareForShutdown() signal from DBus
    allows Unattended Upgrade to run _before_ the jobs related to shutdown are
    queued thus package upgrades can safely restart services without
    risking causing deadlocks or breaking part of the shutdown actions.
    Also ask running unattended-upgrades to stop when shutdown starts even in
    InstallOnShutdown mode and refactor most of unattended-upgrade-shutdown to
    UnattendedUpgradesShutdown class. (LP: #1778219)
  * Increase logind's InhibitDelayMaxSec to 30s. (LP: #1778219)
    This allows more time for unattended-upgrades to shut down gracefully
    or even install a few packages in InstallOnShutdown mode, but is still a
    big step back from the 30 minutes allowed for InstallOnShutdown previously.
    Users enabling InstallOnShutdown node are advised to increase
    InhibitDelayMaxSec even further possibly to 30 minutes.
    - Add NEWS entry about increasing InhibitDelayMaxSec and InstallOnShutdown
      changes
  * Ignore "W503 line break before binary operator"
    because it will become the best practice and breaks the build
  * Stop using ActionGroups, they interfere with apt.Cache.clear()
    causing all autoremovable packages to be handled as newly autoremovable
    ones and be removed by default. Dropping ActionGroup usage does not slow
    down the most frequent case of not having anything to upgrade and when
    there are packages to upgrade the gain is small compared to the actual
    package installation.
    Also collect autoremovable packages before adjusting candidates because that
    also changed .is_auto_removable attribute of some of them. (LP: #1803749)

  * unattended-upgrades: fix Unlocked context manager. (LP: #1602536)
    The Unlocked context manager did correctly unlock but did not
    reacquire the lock which means that in minimal-upgrade step
    mode it is possible to run apt code without a lock. If something
    else (like landscape, apt, synaptic, packagekit) locks the cache
    in the meantime this will work and u-u will get dpkg errors
    because dpkg will not be able to perform its operations. It is
    less of an issue in non-minimal mode, but even then the auto-remove
    step may fail in this way.

unattended-upgrades (0.96ubuntu1) artful; urgency=low

  * Merge from Debian unstable (LP: #1714019)
    - Remaining changes:
      - Recover from broken dh_installinit override in versions < 0.93.1ubuntu3
      - unattended-upgrades: Do not automatically upgrade the development
        release of Ubuntu unless Unattended-Upgrade::DevRelease is true.
    - Dropped changes, included in Debian:
      - Cherry-pick 2e5deed, f26edb4 from upstream to add support for a
        --download-only option, enabling us to download updates at a random
        time of day by default but apply them predictably in the 6am-7am
        window.
      - Fix PEP8 failures (replace except: with except Exception:)
      - unattended-upgrades: Provide some information and create a log entry
        when there is a failure to parse the allowed origins.
      - Add UbuntuESM to the list of sources automatically upgraded from by
        default.
      - Complete the solution for the unattended-upgrades.service unit not
        correctly working
      - d/rules : Remove the override_dh_installinit. The stop option is no
        longer available so the command falls back to default. This is the
        normal behavior so the override is not required
      - d/unattended-upgrades.init : Add Default-Start runlevels, otherwise
        the unattended-upgrades.service unit cannot be enabled on boot
      - d/postinst : Cleanup the stop symlinks created by the wrong
        override_dh_installinit. Without that, the systemd unit cannot be
        enabled correctly.
        Force disable the service before deb-systemd-helper runs so the old
        symlink is not left dangling (workaround for Debian Bug #797108).
        Force enable and start of the systemd unit to work around Debian Bug
        #797108 which fails to enable systemd units correctly when
        WantedBy= statement is changed which is the case here.
      - d/unattended-upgrades.service : Fix the service so it runs correctly on
        shutdown :
        - Remove DefaultDependencies=no : Breaks normal shutdown dependencies
        - Set After= to network.target and local-fs.target. Since our service
          is now ExecStop, it will run before network and local-fs become
          unavailable.
        - Add RequiresMountsFor=/var/log /var/run /var/lib /boot : Necessary if
          /var is a separate file system. Set WantedBy= to multi-user.target
      - Add DEP8 tests to verify the following :
        - Verify that the unattended-upgrades.service unit is enabled and
          started.
        - Verify that InstallOnShutdown works when configured.
      - The systemd unit needs to be an ExecStop since it is is activated on
        shutdown. Otherwise, it will get scheduled after completion of
        the local-fs.target. In the case where /var is a separate
        filesystem, unattended-upgrade-shutdown will hang until timeout
        since /var/run is expected but no longer there
      - When performing a sanity check for packages to install or upgrade
        return false when either there are no packages in the cache or the
        package to upgrade is not in the change set.
      - Do not mark packages for deletion / autoremoval if unattended-upgrades
        is being run in dry-run mode.
      - Store delay command line option as an int not a string since we do
        maths with it.
