  * Revert to running unattended-upgrades.service in multi-user.target
  * Trigger unattended-upgrade-shutdown actions with PrepareForShutdown()
    Performing upgrades in service's ExecStop did not work when the upgrades
    involved restarting services because systemd blocked other stop/start
    actions making maintainer scripts time out and be killed leaving a broken
    system behind.
    Running unattended-upgrades.service before shutdown.target as a oneshot
    service made it run after unmounting filesystems and scheduling services
    properly on shutdown is a complex problem and adding more services to the
    mix make it even more fragile.
    The solution of monitoring PrepareForShutdown() signal from DBus
    allows Unattended Upgrade to run _before_ the jobs related to shutdown are
    queued thus package upgrades can safely restart services without
    risking causing deadlocks or breaking part of the shutdown actions.
    Also ask running unattended-upgrades to stop when shutdown starts even in
    InstallOnShutdown mode and refactor most of unattended-upgrade-shutdown to
    UnattendedUpgradesShutdown class. (LP: #1778219)

    This allows more time for unattended-upgrades to shut down gracefully
    or even install a few packages in InstallOnShutdown mode, but is still a
    big step back from the 30 minutes allowed for InstallOnShutdown previously.
    Users enabling InstallOnShutdown node are advised to increase
    InhibitDelayMaxSec even further, possibly to 30 minutes.

  * Redirect stderr output in upgrade-all-security and upgrade-between-snapshots
    otherwise it breaks the test (LP: #1781446)
  * Skip rebuilding python-apt in upgrade autopkgtests.
    Python-apt has a new build dependency making the rebuilding as is failing

    already. (LP: #1781586)
  * Install release's latest python-apt in upgrade-all-security
  * Don't check blacklist too early and report updates from not allowed origins as kept back.

    (LP: #1781176)
  * Run unattended-upgrades.service before shutdown.target as a oneshot service.
    Performing upgrades in service's ExecStop did not work when the upgrades
    involved restarting services because systemd blocked other stop/start actions

    behind. (LP: #1778219)
  * Use os.environ[] to set debconf to NON_INTERACTIVE instead of os.putenv()

    to set environment for subprocesses in which case os.putenv()'s effect is

  * unattended-upgrades: fix Unlocked context manager.
    The Unlocked context manager did correctly unlock but did not
    reacquire the lock which means that in minimal-upgrade step
    mode it is possible to run apt code without a lock. If something
    else (like landscape, apt, synaptic, packagekit) locks the cache
    in the meantime this will work and u-u will get dpkg errors
    because dpkg will not be able to perform its operations. It is
    less of an issue in non-minimal mode, but even then the auto-remove
    step may fail in this way.

      Force disable the service before deb-systemd-helper runs so the old
      symlink is not left dangling (workaround for Debian Bug #797108).
      Force enable and start of the systemd unit to work around Debian Bug
      #797108 which fails to enable systemd units correctly when WantedBy=
      statement is changed which is the case here.
    - d/unattended-upgrades.service : Fix the service so it runs correctly on
      shutdown :
        Remove DefaultDependencies=no : Breaks normal shutdown dependencies
        Set After= to network.target and local-fs.target. Since our service is
        now ExecStop, it will run before network and local-fs become
