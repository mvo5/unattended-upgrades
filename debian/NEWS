unattended-upgrades (1.1ubuntu1.18.04.7) bionic; urgency=medium

  When InstallOnShutdown was configured unattended-upgrades in
  versions before 1.1ubuntu1.18.04.7 installed updates _after_ the
  shutdown transaction is started by systemd making maintainer scripts
  restarting services fail or wait in a deadlock until being killed by
  shutdown's timeout leaving a broken installation behind.

  Starting with version 1.1ubuntu1.18.04.7 configuring InstallOnShutdown
  makes unattended-upgrades start package installations _before_ the
  shutdown transaction is started, when PrepareForShutdown() signal is
  received via DBus.

  Unattended-upgrades 1.1ubuntu1.18.04.7 also increases logind's
  InhibitDelayMaxSec to 30 seconds. This allows more time for
  unattended-upgrades to shut down gracefully or even install a few
  packages in InstallOnShutdown mode, but is still a big step back from
  the 30 minutes allowed for InstallOnShutdown previously.

  Users enabling InstallOnShutdown mode are advised to increase
  InhibitDelayMaxSec even further, possibly to 30 minutes.

unattended-upgrades (0.99) unstable; urgency=medium

  Unattended-upgrades in previous versions defaulted to install
  security updates only on Debian by using the label=Debian-Security
  origin pattern. Now it is changed to allow updates with label=Debian,
  which allows applying stable updates in stable releases and following
  all package updates in testing and unstable.

  In stable releases this unlocks installation of security updates
  depending on package versions present only in stable updates.

  Note that testing and unstable can often contain packages for which
  installation or upgrade performed by unattended-upgrades fails and
  requires the administrator to fix the system later.

  If you would like to prevent unattended-upgrades from performing
  updates please run "sudo dpkg-reconfigure unattended-upgrades".

unattended-upgrades (0.95) unstable; urgency=medium

  Unattended-upgrades now defaults to installing upgrades in minimal
  steps to ensure leaving the system in a consistent state when the
  system starts shutting in the middle of an upgrade.

  With the previous default of performing all upgrades in one shot
  the installations could take more than 15 minutes which was the
  final timeout after which unattended-upgrade and dpkg were killed
  leaving half-installed packages behind on shutdown.

unattended-upgrades (0.50) unstable; urgency=low

  When running with the --debug switch, previous versions of
  unattended-upgrades would just print what they do, but not
  actually perform any dpkg actions like installing or upgrading. 
  
  This behavior has *changed* in version 0.50 it will now 
  install/upgrade. There is a new option called "--dry-run" to 
  get this behavior back.
